  - get an image element from the DOM (if using IDS or querySelector to grab the EXISTING img element)
  - Function to render this dom
  - Function to get random images from all goats ARRAY
    - math.random get random image - gets a random index from allGoat array. allGoat.length
    - compare the two randoms and confirm they are not the same. while loop to make sure its never the same.

    - incremenet view for that object

- Prototype methods (shouldnt need them)

   incremenet global click counter
   increment
   generate new random images
   increment click. event.target.src 
   stop or removeEventListner!!!!
   render a list of template literal strings  IE: "bunny-goat was view 5 times and clicked 4 times."
